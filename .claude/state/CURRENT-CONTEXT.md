# CURRENT CONTEXT

## Last Mode: NONE (Initial Setup)
## Timestamp: Project Initialization

---

## Current Work Focus
Project planning complete. Ready to begin Phase 1: Foundation.

## What Was Done
- Created comprehensive build plan (OPTION-C-BUILD-PLAN.md)
- Defined complete directory structure
- Designed Supabase database schema
- Created Sanity CMS schemas
- Designed Cloudflare Stream integration
- Set up APEX orchestration files

## What's Next
1. **Initialize monorepo** - Turborepo with pnpm workspaces
2. **Create Next.js app** - App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind
3. **Set up Sanity** - Create project, deploy studio
4. **Set up Supabase** - Create project, run migrations
5. **Configure Cloudflare Stream** - Account setup, API tokens

## Blockers
- Need church branding assets
- Need to confirm domain choice
- Need YouTube channel ID for migration

## Decisions Made
- Stack: Next.js 14 + Sanity + Supabase + Cloudflare Stream
- Hosting: Vercel
- Video Strategy: Hybrid (YouTube embeds initially, migrate to CF Stream)
- Search: Postgres full-text (Algolia if needed later)

## For Next Mode
**REAPER**: No code yet to audit
**ARCHITECT**: Begin with monorepo initialization
**DESIGNER**: Waiting for branding assets
**STRATEGIST**: Planning complete, execute plan
